    <h1>Selected Sonnets of William Shakespeare</h1>

    <p>
        Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<br>
        Thou art more lovely and more temperate:<br>
        Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
        And summer's lease hath all too short a date:<br>
        Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br>
        And often is his gold complexion dimmed;<br>
        And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br>
        By chance or nature's changing course untrimmed;<br>
        But thy eternal summer shall not fade<br>
        Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;<br>
        Nor shall Death brag thou wanderest in his shade,<br>
        When in eternal lines to time thou growest:<br>
        So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,<br>
        So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let me not to the marriage of true minds<br>
        Admit impediments. Love is not love<br>
        Which alters when it alteration finds,<br>
        Or bends with the remover to remove:<br>
        O no! it is an ever-fixed mark<br>
        That looks on tempests and is never shaken;<br>
        It is the star to every wandering bark,<br>
        Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.<br>
        Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks<br>
        Within his bending sickle's compass come:<br>
        Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,<br>
        But bears it out even to the edge of doom.<br>
        If this be error and upon me proved,<br>
        I never writ, nor no man ever loved.
    </p>

    <p>
         My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;<br>
        Coral is far more red than her lips' red;<br>
        If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;<br>
        If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.<br>
        I have seen roses damasked, red and white,<br>
        But no such roses see I in her cheeks;<br>
        And in some perfumes is there more delight<br>
        Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.<br>
        I love to hear her speak, yet well I know<br>
        That music hath a far more pleasing sound;<br>
        I grant I never saw a goddess go;<br>
        My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:<br>
        And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare<br>
        As any she belied with false compare.
